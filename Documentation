1.	Problem Statement
Create a lexical analyzer (LA) for the programming language Rat23S.  The LA should be able to read and identify 6 token types (identifiers, keywords, integers, reals, operators, and separators) including any whitespaces by developing a DFSM for each token. 
2.	How to use your program  
<write detailed steps/Instructions how to execute your program>
e.g.,
Step1) Click on  lexer.exe
Step2) specify the input file (testcase file)
Step3) specify the output file
Or
Step 1) goto command line
Step 2) type    lexer.exe  <input file> <output file>
Step 3) Hit the CR

3.	Design of your program
< write major components of your program. Also, data structures you are utilizing, particular algorithms you have chosen etc. >

4.	Any Limitation
<All features are running according to the assignment but  you limit your program due to resource limitations, such as
Maximum number of lines in the source code, size of the identifier, integer etc.      Say ‘None’ if there is no limitation>

5.	Any shortcomings
<Anything you could NOT implement although that is required by the
Assignment. Say ‘None’ if there is no shortcoming>
